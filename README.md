## Data Analysis
## TikTok Compared to Streaming Sites:
For all the streaming sites, they showed similar trends in the increase of revenue and users, where there is an increase in revenue and a significant increase in users/subscribers. These numbers are expected, due to the following factors:

First, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire country was under lockdown for months. With the extended period of time indoors, people had to get creative on how to spend their time. The graphs will portray a significant increase in subscribers from 2019 to 2020, which is peak lockdown; and then a significant decrease from 2021 to 2022 when lockdowns eased. This corresponds with an increase in screentime, as more people are watching shows on different platforms.

Lastly, as the users/subscribers increased, the revenue for the companies also increased. The difference in severity can be explained due to the fact that users of streaming platforms tend to share accounts and costs, especially during the pandemic where majority of the population became unemployed. Nonetheless, the stock prices for these companies still had a significant increase from 2019 to 2020.

In the following section, we will be diving deeper into the numbers for the aforementioned streaming revenue and users for Netflix, Hulu, Twitch, YouTube, and finally TikTok.

## Netflix Revenue & Netflix Subscribers
For Netflix, there was an average increase in subscribers of 27.8% pre-pandemic (2011 to 2018) and an inrease of 24% during the pandemic (2019 to 2020).

In terms of revenue, Netflix had an average increase of 25.2% pre-pandemic (2011 to 2018) and an increase of 17.1% during the pandemic (2019 to 2020).

## Hulu Revenue & Hulu Subscribers
For Hulu, there was an average increase in subscribers of 39.5% pre-pandemic (2010 to 2018) and an inrease of 35% during the pandemic (2019 to 2020).

In terms of revenue, Hulu had an average increase of 35% pre-pandemic (2010 to 2018) and an increase of 19.30% during the pandemic (2019 to 2020).

## Twitch Revenue & Twitch Concurrent Viewers
For Twitch, there was an average increase in subscribers of 27% pre-pandemic (2016 to 2018) and an inrease of 68% during the pandemic (2019 to 2020).

In terms of revenue, Twitch had an average increase of 81% pre-pandemic (2016 to 2018) and an increase of 13% during the pandemic (2019 to 2020).

## YouTube Revenue & Youtube Premium Subscribers

In terms of revenue, TikTok had an average increase of 135.5% pre-pandemic (2017 to 2019) and an increase of 292% during the pandemic (2020 to 2021).

## Conclusion 
Based on the data we gathered and analyzed, we were able to infer the following conclusions:

First, there was a significant increase in both users and revenue between 2020 to 2021 across all the different social media platforms (Facebook, Hulu, Netflix, etc.), but TikTok succeeded way more than expected and that was boosted due to the pandemic. With everyone stuck at home during the lockdown, a lot of people had to pre-occupy themselves, which involved being on the computer a lot more. The internet became our connection to the “outside world” and a lot of school/work were also held online.

Directly from the first point, the second major conclusion is that there was a significant decrease come 2022 to 2023 because lockdown restrictions eased and people were able to spend their time somewhere else again. With schools and work also reverting from hybrid to back to the office settings, people have started spending less time online, which explains why there was a significant decrease.

Lastly, TikTok’s success is very interesting to note because compared to other well-established social media platforms, it is relatively younger. However, the impact of its success can be seen with other social media companies mimicking its algorithm. Examples of this include Facebook’s and Instagram’s reels, Snapchat’s Spotlight feature, and YouTube shorts.
